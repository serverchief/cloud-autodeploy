Scripts here are used to refresh the builds of the management server with those
made out of our CI system. The CI system is internal at the moment.


build.cfg - contains build information given to the CI system
        - branch, BUILDABLE_TARGET
        - distro of mgmt server tarball

You may leave the rest as they are defaults and should work fine.

environment.cfg - typically the VM where you intended to install above build of
mgmt server. SSH access to be available and credentials are in the config file.

deployment.cfg - the JSON network model configuration file generated by Marvin so
the mgmt server can be configured. See the Marvin tutorial on how to fetch these.

other options - skip-host - will skip IPMI/PXE refresh of the hosts
        - install-marvin - will pull the latest marvin tarball from the CI
          system and install it
